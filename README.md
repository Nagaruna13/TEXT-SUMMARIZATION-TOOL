TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOL
##DESCRIPTION
Text summarization is the process of shortening a long text document by generating a concise and coherent version that captures the key information. It‚Äôs widely used in applications like news summarization, academic research digests, and automatic document classification.

There are two main approaches:

Extractive Summarization:

Selects important sentences or phrases directly from the original text.

No rewording; just extracts and ranks the original sentences.

Easier to implement and more interpretable.

Abstractive Summarization:

Generates new sentences that may not exist in the original text.

Uses deep learning models like Transformers.

More complex but yields human-like summaries.

In this task, we‚Äôll focus on extractive summarization using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and network-based ranking algorithms like TextRank.

Key Concepts Used
Tokenization: Breaking text into words or sentences.

Stopwords Removal: Filtering common words (e.g., ‚Äúis‚Äù, ‚Äúthe‚Äù) which don't carry significant meaning.

Frequency Table: Calculates word importance.

Sentence Scoring: Scores each sentence based on the frequency of important words.

Summary Generation: Selects top sentences for the final summary.
